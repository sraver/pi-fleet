# Pi fleet

This is a collection of the configuration scripts for my Pi images.

Huge props to [gitbls](https://github.com/gitbls), without his [SD Manager](https://github.com/gitbls) I
would still be doing this with some random scripts and tons of manual steps. `sdm` enabled me to start migrating to this
more deterministic building of the images. Amazing piece of work <3
